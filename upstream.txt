Upstream is usually used as the remote to point to a master or owner repository that you have forked. This is done as on your forked repository you will have read/write (pull/push) permissions, however on the root directory you will most likely only have the option to pull. 

As you continue to work on your fork it will not be updated with changes on the root repository. The upstream remote is used to pull changes into your fork that you can then merge so you can keep up with the latest changes AND develope your fork.
